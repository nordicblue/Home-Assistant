# Home-Assistant
My Home Assistant configuration

This is my home assistant configuration. I have a ton of little projects going on currently and, as soon as I get some extra time on my hands, I will update the README with everything I have configured so far. 

For now, it was important for me to have a backup of the configuration somewhere so safe keeping. 

Enjoy!
